The code represents a PyTorch module called "Inception". This module is inspired by the Inception module in the Inception architecture used in the GoogLeNet neural network.


The module takes in the following parameters:



in_channels: Number of input channels (input features).

n_filters: Number of filters per convolution layer => out_channels = 4*n_filters.

kernel_sizes: List of kernel sizes for each convolution. Each kernel size must be an odd number that meets -> "kernel_size % 2 != 0". This is necessary because of padding size. For correction of kernel_sizes use the function "correct_sizes".

bottleneck_channels: Number of output channels in the bottleneck. Bottleneck will not be used if the number of in_channels is equal to 1.

activation: Activation function for output tensor (nn.ReLU()).

return_indices: Indices are needed only if we want to create decoder with InceptionTranspose with MaxUnpool1d.


The module contains the following layers and operations:



If in_channels > 1, then it uses a bottleneck that is a 1D convolution layer with input_channels=in_channels, output_channels=bottleneck_channels, kernel_size=1, stride=1 and bias=False. Otherwise, a pass_through layer is used.

Three 1D convolution layers using the input from the bottleneck layer. Each convolution layer has in_channels=bottleneck_channels, out_channels=n_filters, kernel_size=kernel_sizes[0],1 or 2, stride=1, padding=kernel_sizes[0] // 2,1 or 2 // 2 and bias=False, respectively.

A 1D convolution layer with input from the maximum pooling layer. The layer has in_channels=in_channels, out_channels=n_filters, kernel_size=1, stride=1, padding=0 and bias=False.

Max pooling layer with kernel size=3, stride=1, padding=1 and return_indices, if self.return_indices=True.

A batch normalization layer that normalizes the output of the concatenation of the previous four layers.

An activation function, here the Rectified Linear Unit, ReLU.


The module has a forward method that performs the following operations:\n- Pass the input through the bottleneck and the maximum pooling layer.



Perform convolution on each input of the the bottleneck layer and the maximum pooling layer.

Concatenate the outputs from the previous convolution layers.

Normalize the output using batch normalization.

Use an activation function on the normalized output.


If return_indices=True, the method will return the max-pooling indices along with the output. Otherwise, only the output is returned.
